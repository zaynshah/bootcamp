# SQL & CRUD Operations

## Learning Objectives

- List the four elements of a CRUD system
- Create a row to a table using a `INSERT` keyword
- Read a row from a table using the `SELECT` keyword
- Order returned data from a table using `ORDER BY`
- Limit the amount of data retrieved from a table by using `LIMIT`
- Update a row on a table using a `UPDATE` keyword
- Delete a row from a table using a `DELETE` keyword

## Pre-work

### Set Up

If it hasn't been created, please create a thread 'Week 8: SQL & CRUD Operations Pre-Work'

### Exercise

**Exercise 1**

- What is CRUD? Write a short description for each element and share it in the thread.

**Exercise 2**

You have a scenario of the following:

You are analysing a school:

- There are 14 different teachers, all of them of varying roles and teaching multiple subjects (including the Headteacher)
- There are 500 students in total.
- Each student is between the ages of 11 and 18, and study a fixed syllabus for the year.
- Each year group studies 8 fixed subjects a year

_Individual task_:

- Write down all of the different parts of the school, and draw a concept map as to how they all relate.
- Think about all of the information you might need for each part, e.g. student information? Subject name and year group that it is taught in?

### Group Work

In groups of 3-4, think about the following question using your context from Exercise 2: **how many teachers teach students that are under the age of 14?**

- How would you break down the question in to the data that you would need?
- How do they relate to each other?
- If you had to create a table with different data fields to model you answer, which fields would you need?

Draw out what your table might look like.

Share your table drawings in the thread.

## Workshop

### Setup

Load the Pokemon dataset into a database and make sure you can run the code in `02_crud_operation.js`

### Live Code

In the `02_crud_operation.js` file you will find the scaffolding for a server with instructions for each endpoint.
