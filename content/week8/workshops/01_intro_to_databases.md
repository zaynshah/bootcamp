# Intro to Databases

## Learning Objectives

Be the end of this session a student should be able to,

- Describe the flow of data from the front end to the backend and onto the database
- Define the problem that databases solve in web development
- List the advantages of using a database over other forms of storage (e.g. ticker tape, memory, file on disk)
- Create a database using SQLite in the terminal
- Write an SQL query to create a new record in a table
- Write an SQL query to retrieve all data from a table
- Write an SQL query to retrieve specific columns from a table

## Pre-work

### Setup

If you haven't already install SQLite

`brew install sqlite`

### Research

Before the workshop you should have answers to the following questions

1. What is a database?
2. What is SQL?
3. What problem does SQL solve?
4. What is MySQL?

### Exercise

Start working through SQLBolt

https://sqlbolt.com/

Don't worry too much about how far you get - there will be plenty of time over the week to continue working on it.

## Workshop

### Lecture

To set the scene, quickly (~5 minutes) recap how data is passed from the front end, to the back end and onto a database.

### Lecture

Take some time to walk through different types of storage that are currently used or have been used in the past

1. In Memory
2. Physical e.g. tape, paper
3. On Disk in a file
4. And finally...Databases

Poll the class for what they expect the positives and negatives would be of each option after explaining it.

### Live Code

For the rest of the session, Live Code an example a database of all of a selection of the students including some of their information. You should include

1. Creating the Table
2. Adding Rows
3. Selecting Columns
4. Selecting Records based on qualities

You are welcome to continue expanding on the topics for the rest of the session
