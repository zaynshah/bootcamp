          I am a recently graduated Mechanical Engineer, who is self-motivated.
          I have adapted to new situations, working effectively as a team and
          independently. I have gained numerical an analytical skills as well as
          developing an extensive range of IT skills.

      <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
      <strong>2019-2020: </strong> Engineering System Simulation <br /><strong
        >Topic:</strong
      >
      To develop a simulation tool to solve 1D FEM static diffusion-reaction and
      then extend the code for transient cases (71%) <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Created a comprehensive complex automated FEM tool with the user only
          needing to input their desired parameters
        </li>
        <li>
          Performed core programming skills; includes creating and integrating
          numerous functions, logic, statements (for/while loops), debugging and
          overall good practice by validating code/functions against standard
          test cases
        </li>
        <li>
          Executed the finite element solver for both static/transient problems;
          High-quality plots and analysis compiled in a final report
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>2019:</strong> Paid Research internship, Sponsored by Vestas and
      Swansea University <br />
      <strong>Topic: </strong>Hot-wire testing and investigating the effects of
      Vortex Generators (VGs)
      <ul>
        <li>
          Investigated VGs impact on lift and drag; independent planning and
          experimental testing for various conditions were carried out; data
          analysis completed using Excel and MATLAB with results communicated to
          supervisor daily
        </li>
        <li>
          Carried out hot wire and flow-visualisation experiments using wool
          tufts for flow validation purposes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Design Project Lead</strong><br />
      <strong>Project:</strong> Design, Make & Race A Remote-Controlled Car
      (74%)<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Designed and made a remote-controlled car by utilising additive
          technology while working efficiently within a group
        </li>
        <li>
          Led in CAD (3D-designing, FEA and renderings), technical drawings,
          formatting, business report and manufacturing
        </li>
        <li>
          Advised group members on how to improve and took charge of
          responsibilities; the second group report increased by 4%
        </li>
