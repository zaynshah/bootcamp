## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, an attendee should be able to

- Explain the distinct roles of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in developing websites
- Understand the importance of semantic HTML and choosing appropriate HTML elements
- Create a simple HTML page with CSS styling and launch it in their local browser
- Use the Chrome developer tools to select elements on the page and modify their content and styling

## Pre Work

### 1. Research

**Setup:** If nobody has done so already, create a thread on Slack titled "Intro to Front End Research". You'll be sharing your work in here.

Write 100-200 words to describing what HTML, CSS and JavaScript do and the relationship between them. You should share your work in the above thread when you have written them.

### 2. Concept Map

Either using a pen and paper or a tool like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) create a Concept Map of everything you currently know about Front End Web Development.

If you've not heard of a concept map before, take a moment to learn about them

- [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-concept-maps)
- [Centre for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.byu.edu/tip/concept-mapping)

Try not to worry too much about making it look amazing or problem free. The messier the better.

Also, don't worry if their are large gaps in your concept map! The point is to state your understanding at this point to give us a base to work from.

## Workshop

### Live Code

Use live coding to demonstrate the four learning objectives.

### Pair Programming

Students should pair program the following wireframe website. They should swap every ten minutes. Exercise should take 30-40 minutes.
