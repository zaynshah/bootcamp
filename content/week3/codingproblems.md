# Coding Problems

Constant Improvement is one of Sigma Labs founding principles. It is only through incremental, sustained work that we can become better programmers.

We're going to spend some time every day working through a coding problem either individually, as a pair or as group.

## Session Length

We'll be problem solving for about 25 minutes with a further 5 minutes to go through our answers.

## Instructions

Before starting make sure you've signed up to Codewars and can access the dashboard.
