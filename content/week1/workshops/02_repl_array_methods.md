## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, an attendee should be able to

- Define what a REPL is and explain why it's useful to programmers
- Launch the Deno REPL, import parts of your blackjack and run experiments with them
- List some of the most common array methods and their return types
- Use `map` and `reduce` to derive useful results from arrays

## Pre-work

### 1. Setup

If you haven't already, make sure you have Node and NPM installed. You can find the install instructions [here](/getting-setup.md#39-node--npm)

### 2. Research

Research and find answers to the following questions

1. What is a REPL?
2. Why is a REPL useful for programmers?
3. How would you launch a Deno REPL?

### 3. Exercises

**Setup:** If nobody has done so already, create a thread on Slack titled "Array Methods Research". You'll be sharing useful links in there.

In JavaScript, we have some really useful built in methods that can help us write concise, powerful code involving arrays. These are `some()`, `every()`, `map()`, `filter()` and `reduce()`

In this repository you can find a set of exercises that run through each of these array methods.

Follow the setup instructions and complete the exercises.

**Note:** You are expected to research and find resources to assist you in completing these exercises. If you find a resources that helps you, be sure to share it on Slack.
