# Quality Assurance

QAs as are the arbiters of quality for a project. They are responsible for making sure that projects and codebases are of a high quality and that after a ticket has been completed. If a project is buggy it is their responsibility to make sure that bugs get fixed.

Their key responsibilities are to

- Record bugs in the project management board when found
- Confirm that tickets have been completed compared to the specification on tickets written by Project Managers
- Ensure that the quality of the code in the codebase is high
- Manually test the product to make sure it works
- Write unit tests for areas of the product that aren't currently tested
- Writing documentation

## Tips

- You are there to guide the other engineers to writing great code
- The best service you can be to your team is writing each unit tests for code that will commonly break
- Be sure to enable running tests when you deploy your code (work with the Architect/DevOps team member to do this)

## Common Pitfalls

Lots of people run into the same issue with this role, for example

- Not testing all of the edge cases for software (e.g. what happens if I enter `(*Â£&!(!))` into this email box?)
- Getting annoyed at engineers for writing buggy code, help them to fix it instead
- When reporting tickets, give as much information as you can to be able to reproduce it
