#Â Engineer

Engineers are the people on the team who write code to the clients requirements. They are concerned with writing high quality code in a consistent style that is easy to understand and make edits to.

Their key responsibilities are to

- Write high quality code
- Complete ticket of work assigned to them by Project Managers
- Review Pull Requests from other engineers
- Write unit tests for their code
- Make sure that the code that they're written works

## Tips

- Use a common code style from the start of the project that you all agree on (e.g. https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Communicate with other engineers are much as possible
- Follow tickets are closely as possible and try not work beyond them
- Always give helpful, constructive feedback to other team members
- Commit often, commit always

## Common Pitfalls

Lots of people run into the same issue with this role, for example

- Not communicating on what they're working on all of the time
- Working on the same ticket as somebody else because they didn't communicate
- Working on huge amount of work before opening a Pull Request - PRs should be as small as possible!
- Spending too long a ticket to get is exactly perfect without sharing their work, the aim of this project is to move quickly (think about the 80/20 rule)
