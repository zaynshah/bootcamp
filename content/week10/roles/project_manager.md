#Â Project Manager

In the end, it is the role of the PM to make sure that the project arrives on time with all of the features that have been promised. They are also responsible for making sure everyone knows what they're working on without any conflicts. It is the Project Managers job to split up large pieces of work into smaller pieces (commonly called tickets) for engineers to work on.

Their key responsibilities are to

- Manage the project management board
- Assign work to engineers and other team members
- Run Morning Stand-ups and End of Day Wrap-ups
- Run Planning Meetings at the start of every day
- Run Retrospectives are the end of the week
- Ensure that everyone knows what they're meant to working on

## Tips

- Over-communicate with everything that is happening
- It pays off to plan as much as you can ahead of time before engineers start working
- Be strict with running meetings, make sure everyone is heard and that they begin and finish on time

## Common Pitfalls

Lots of people run into the same issue with this role, for example

- Not properly defining pieces of work with enough information
- Multiple people working on the same tickets
- The loudest people making all the decisions for the team (make sure everyone is heard!)
- Projects running out of time because the scope was too large
