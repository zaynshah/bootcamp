# Architect & DevOps

This role is designed to give a high level overview of the project and to make sure that all of the part fit together. It is this roles responsibility to not only ensure that high level design decisions are made (e.g. database design, API design) but that all of the engineers in the team understand how they work.

Their key responsibilities are to

- Make software design decisions such as designing how the API and frontend should communicate
- Communicating with engineers to ensure that design decisions are respected
- Making sure tickets written by Project Managers are up to date with decisions made
- Deploying Frontend and Backends to web based services so the project is accessible over the internet
- Setting up version control for the team (i.e. Git & Github)
- Choosing a code style for the project (e.g. https://github.com/airbnb/javascript or https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) and making sure everyone follows it

## Tips

- You should be the final decision maker - that **doesn't** mean you alone should make decisions. Work as a team.
- Try to take a high level view of the project. How will everything fit together?
- Try to setup "Automated Deployment" linked to the Github repository. This means your team will never have to deploy and changes can be seen online immediately.

## Common Pitfalls

Lots of people run into the same issue with this role, for example

- Not communicating software design decisions to the whole team
- Not working with other team members to help them make decisions
- Not considering how the frontend and backend will communicate
