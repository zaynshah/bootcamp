# Getting Setup for Group Project

## 1. Meet Your Team (5 mins)

You should already know who you'll be working with but if not, teams will be assigned now

## 2. Assign Roles (~5 minutes)

In this project _everyone_ will be playing the role of an Engineer but you will also have a secondary role as either a

- Project Manager or
- QA Tester or
- Architect & Dev Ops

Assign roles to everyone. Don't worry too much, you'll have another chance to take a role next week

## 3. Discover Your Role (20 mins)

Spend some time reviewing the material in the `roles` folder relating to the role that you'll be playing. Try and build some knowledge of what your role will be doing in this project.

## 4. Discuss Your Role (30 mins)

Next, let's spend some time researching each of the roles that you're going to be running for the next week.

Split into groups depending on the role that you'll be playing (e.g. all of the PMs should be in a group)

Research and brainstorm

1. The tasks that your role will be responsible for
2. The qualities you need to exhibit to do the role well
3. How you're going to make sure you do your role well

## 5. Group Discussion (15 mins)

After this discussion we'll come back together and we'll run through the tasks that you will be solely responsible for.

## 6. Setup Trello Boards (10 mins)

To get setup, the Project Manager for each team should make a copy of this Trello board

https://trello.com/b/SAMaSV2a/world-bank-dashboard-project

You can make a copy by going to `Show Menu` > `More` > `Copy Board`

Next, invite all of your teammates and make sure they all have access

## 7. Introduce Trello Boards (10 minutes)

The following topics should be covered by the teacher

1. What is a project management board? Why do they exist?
2. How do you create tickets from templates?
3. How do you assign tickets?
4. Whose job is it to create tickets (Hint: Everyone (but the ultimate responsibility is the PM))

## 8. Workshop

Continue onto the [Writing Tickets](./02_writing_tickets.md) workshop

When the workshop has been completed the students should start converting [the user stories](../README.md#user_stories) for this week into tickets in trello. The PM should lead on this.
