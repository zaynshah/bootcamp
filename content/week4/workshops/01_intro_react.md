# Introduction to React & Components

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the problem that React solves
- Define what the Virtual DOM is and why it is beneficial
- Break down a design of website into a set components
- Create a react app using `create-react-app`
- Create a component and add it to the react app
- Use yarn to run a React app

## Pre-work

### Setup

If you haven’t already, install `yarn`:

https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable

As well as this, install `create-react-app`, which is a very useful package that creates React applications with a single command.

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/

### Read

**Setup:** If no one has created one, create a thread in the #workshops Slack channel named:
‘Intro to React and Components’.

Read the first three chapters of the Getting Started Guide on the React JS docs: 

- https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html
- https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html
- https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html

### Watch

### Write

Make a list of all the noticeable differences between the plain JS/HTML code you have been writing so far and React as you have read it.

Write 50-100 words on what React is and share it in the workshop thread.

## Workshop

### Lecture

Explain how react has a few key improvements over DOM Manipulation

- Componentization
- Virtual DOM
- More easily testable (specific tools)
- Helps us manage “state”
- It’s used in lots of places (React Native for Mobile, React for VR)

The VDOM will need to be specifically called out. You should explain using a diagram similar to in the article here

### Create

Explain to the students how a website could be broken down into components. Take a screenshot of a website and run through how it could be broken down.

Next, give the students a selection of websites and ask them to do the same. Show them a good example solution and then give them another website.

Any website will do for this task but a good example might be Deliveroo as they have been working with it recently.

### Live Code

Spend some time running through `create-react-app` and the basic skeleton of a React App.

### Q+A

​​Leave plenty of time for questions and answers at the end of the session and for experimentation.
