# React Testing Workshop

## Learning Objectives

- Use yarn to add dependencies to a node project
- Write unit tests using `jest` and `react-testing-library` to test individual components
- Write a unit test that confirms an element is present using `jest`
- Write a unit test that triggers a button click using `jest`
- Write a unit test that tests that an element returns the correct HTML based on the props given

## Pre-work

### Setup

Make sure that you’ve got jest and react-testing-library added as dependencies for your project. You can check if they are by reading your package.json file.

If you not you can add them by running the commands
`yarn add @testing-library/react`
and
`yarn add --dev jest`

### Research

**Setup:** If it hasn’t been created, create a thread in the #workshops channel titles ‘Jest & React Testing Library’

Spend some time familiarising yourself with Jest - our new testing library - and React Testing Library - a great helper library.

Answer the following questions in as much depth as you can and post them in a thread mentioned above

- What are the differences between Jest and Deno’s built in testing library
- What does React Testing Library do beyond what Jest does?

## Workshop

### Live Code

This article has good examples that can be live coded in the session with plenty of time for experimentation and exploration.
