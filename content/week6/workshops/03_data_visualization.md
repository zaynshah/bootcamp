# Data visualization

> See a previous version of this class [here](https://sigmalabs.rewatch.com/video/8882/data-visualisation-and-matplotlib-coding-workshop-may-26-2021/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, an attendee should be able to

- Explain the role of data visualization and its place within the OSEMN framework
- Use `matplotlib` to generate simple interactive plots from Pandas
- Create different kinds of chart (line, bar, pie etc.)
- Bucket data in order to create histograms from continuous data
- Save images of plots to their filesystem

## Pre-work

### 1. Research (15 mins)

**Setup:** If nobody has done so already, create a thread on Slack titled "Data Visualization Research". You'll be sharing useful links in there.

Find an interesting example of a data visualization. It could be from a news article, blog, infographic etc. Ideally find something more interesting than a classic pie or bar chart. Consider the following questions:

- What is it about the visualization which makes it effective?
- Are there any insights that jump out from the visualization, which would have been harder to spot if you were just inspecting the data?
- Is there anything about the visualization that could be improved?

Be ready to discuss your thoughts with the group!

## Workshop Details

### Challenge (30 mins)

Live code an example of data visualization using Pandas and `matplotlib`.

You should call out:

- How to create a simple line and bar chart
- How to relabel axes
- How to combine aggregate functions with plotting (e.g. create a bar chart showing the largest crowd size at each amenity type)
- How to use `.qcut` to generate a histogram
- How to use `seaborn` to improve the aesthetics of visualizations
- How to save figures to `.png` files

Be sure to leave time for questions and experimentation.
